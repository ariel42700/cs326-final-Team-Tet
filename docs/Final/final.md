Fall 2021

Overview: 
This application was meant to be a portal for students to log in to in order to get results of a job best suited for their needs and wants whether it is on campus or off campus. The student would have been able to set their profile in order to quick apply to a job that they are interested in by having an automatically filled form that would take the information from the profile of the student and send it to the employer.

Team Members: 
Anjali Arigela -- aarigela9 
Ariel S. Lutati  -- ariel42700
Anirudh Tale -- anirudhbappu

User Interface: 
1. Login -- The first page is a login page. This page is where the student will be able to enter their information, or if they do not have user credentials already, they will have the option to register.

2. If you click on the register prompt, another page will be rendered where the student will be able to enter their credentials that they want and if they are available, they will be redirected to the login, else they will have to enter different credentials.
3. The main search page is where the student can select which options they like and based on the query that is generated from these options, a popup will show up.
4. The Job Results popup shows all the jobs that will show a table of all the jobs generated from the search. The student will be able to click on the link in order to get whatever job they clicked's full description.
5. The Job Description Page includes all the information about a specific given job.
6. There is also a profile page in which student profiles will show up in a popup.
