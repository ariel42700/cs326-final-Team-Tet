For this milestone, we had some difficulties in terms of a team member's computer having issues as well as other issues that I will not mention for personal reasons. In the repo, we have started some code for the server.js where we have started to implement the dummy server. There is also the API that has been completed but some issues on client-side. In terms of testing the dummy server, we were not able to install express as Windows was giving us issues, and we were not able to get the help needed to get the issue fixed. Therefore, we were not able to provide the screenshots or the Heroku Application URL. We are however going to meet this week and get the express issue fixed and consistently push to git the changes we have as soon as we are able to fix these issues.
