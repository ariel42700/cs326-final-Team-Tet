Overall Idea:
Innovative Idea Our idea is to create a UMass student job aggregator that allows students to sign up, make a profile, and quickly apply to jobs on and around campus. Employers would get uniform applications directly to their inbox. Our website will build upon the UMass official student job board (https://em.umass.edu/seo/search/JobSearch.aspx) but will improve upon it by creating a better UI, implementing accounts and profiles, allowing for applications to be sent on the site instead of emails, and better sorting and filtering capabilities. We will focus our attention on the student’s experience, but will also make it easier for employers to find qualified candidates.

Important Components There will be a login component for a user on the application. A user can create their own login credentials and that username and password will be stored in the database. When creating their own account, the user will also enter certain profile information that will be stored and used later. When the user logs in, they will be able to see all of the job listings that have been manually entered into the database. The user can filter through the list and find what they are looking for very easily. When they have found a job they would like to apply to, an automatic form is generated with their profile information and this form is sent to the employer email that is listed in the job listing. This way, students can apply to the jobs of their liking without any hassle. There will be a content management component that can only be accessed by an administrator who will help any student who is having trouble with their login credentials, help a student edit their profile, and they will add job listings to the database that will then show up on the user’s side. The database component of this application will be storing specific information related to a user as well as job listings.

Here's the main search page: 

![Page](MainSearchPage_SC.PNG)

In this page, the users will be able to create a search with their specific needs. The dropdown contains the categories of different job types. The user can select work study or not and they can select what location they would prefer if they do.

Here's the popup page layout that will show up as a popup when the user has entered criteria for their search: 

![Page](PopupSearch_SC.PNG)

This is a popup that will show up when the user hits search and it will be containing a table of all of the results matching the search criteria. The Job Title Column will consists of anchor tags which contain links to the specific job description page.

Here's the specific job description page:

![Page](Job_Desc_HTML_SC.png)

This page will show up once a link to the page has been clicked with the specific data related to that specific job.

The wireframes are labeled as MainSearch.drawio where you can open the file in diagrams.net to see the wireframes.
